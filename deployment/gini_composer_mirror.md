# [Gini Composer](http://satis.genee.cn)
It is the repository for Composer packages required for Gini modules. `composer.json` generated by `gini update composer` will include this repository automatically.

## Update Composer Packages for Gini App

Generating Composer configuration file...
   done.
$ composer install
```
## Packagist.org is SO SLOW IN CHINA!!!
We setup `gini-satis.genee.cn` for composer packages included in our `gini` modules so everyone in China could access them quickly.
```
$ gini composer init --no-packagist
Generating Composer configuration file...
   done.
$ composer install
```
